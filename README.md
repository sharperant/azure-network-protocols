<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
</p>
<p>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups.

<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />
</p>
<p>

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell
<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)</b>

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>
</p>
<p>
In this lab we will create two VMs in the same VNET. One will be a Domain Controller, the other will be a Client machine. We will change the DC to a static IP because its offering Active Directory services to the client machine. Client machine will be joined to the domain. We will control the DNS settings on the client machine, the client machine will use the DC as its DNS server.
